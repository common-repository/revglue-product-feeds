== Disclaimer ==

this plugin uses images from two external sources that are part of the data import funtions. These images could be hosted on these two different locations so the external images are used.

1 - From the RevGlue.com image bank such as for category images or icons. 
2 - Affiliate networks direct image links from the top UK affiliate networks such as CJ.com, Awin.com etc. These are product images imported when the data is imported via the APi. 

No harm or illegal activity is connected to these images. These are product or category images coming from reliable sources approved by the RevGlue team. 

== Terms of Use ==

This plugin is offered free to all publishers. The code is not encrypted so the publishers can make further changes in the layout or funtionality. They can hire a wordpress developer or request RevGlue.com development team to help them with the required changes.
